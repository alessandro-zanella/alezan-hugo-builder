### A Python Scraper/Crawler App That Check a Websites Page Source Code for internal Links and visits those links to gather more links (With Compliancy & Safety measures)

## Compliance & Safety 

Using web crawlers like the Python script I provided is **not inherently illegal**, but it depends on **how and where** you use them. Here are the key legal and ethical considerations:

### **1. Check the Website’s `robots.txt` File**

Most websites have a `robots.txt` file (e.g., `https://example.com/robots.txt`) that specifies which pages can or cannot be crawled. While `robots.txt` isn’t legally binding in most cases, **ignoring it may violate terms of service**.

### **2. Website Terms of Service (ToS) Violations**

Many websites explicitly forbid automated scraping in their ToS. **Bypassing these rules could result in legal consequences**, such as being banned from the site or even facing civil action (e.g., breach of contract).

### **3. Copyright & Data Privacy Laws**

- **Scraping personal data** (e.g., emails, user info) may violate privacy laws like **GDPR (EU)** or **CCPA (California)**.
- **Copying large portions of content** could breach copyright laws.

### **4. Avoid DDoS & Overloading Servers**

Sending too many requests in a short time **may be considered an attack**. Some websites **block IPs** or **take legal action** against abusive crawlers. Always use **rate limiting** (e.g., `time.sleep(1)`).

### **5. Web Scraping Court Cases**

- **Legal (or not enforced):**
    - _HiQ Labs v. LinkedIn (2022)_ – A court ruled that scraping **publicly available data** does not violate the **Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)**.
- **Illegal:**
    - _Facebook v. Power Ventures_ – Scraping behind a login page **without permission** was ruled illegal under CFAA.

### **How to Stay Safe?**

✅ Follow `robots.txt` rules.  
✅ Only scrape **public** pages.  
✅ Respect **rate limits** (don’t flood servers).  
✅ Avoid scraping **personal/private data**.  
✅ Read the website’s **ToS** before scraping.
